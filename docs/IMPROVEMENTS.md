# Repository Improvement Plan

> This file tracks every planned improvement, feature, bug fix, and implementation step requested in plan mode. Items move through a lifecycle and are archived on the maintainer's instruction.

## Lifecycle

Every item in this file follows this flow:

```
Recorded → Verified → Issue → Implemented → Archived
```

1. **Recorded** — logged here when a review/finding/feature/fix is discussed in plan mode. Item gets `Problem` and `Possible Fix`.
2. **Verified** — a deeper one-by-one review confirms the item is valid (or rejects it).
   - Valid → a GitHub Issue is created, its number is recorded in `Issue`, and `Actual Fix` is filled in.
   - Invalid → the item is **skipped** (marked `rejected`, not tracked further).
3. **Implemented** — the linked GitHub Issue is closed. The item is updated with `Actual Implemented` and `Changes`, and `Issue` keeps the **Issue number** (not the PR number).
4. **Archived** — moved to `docs/archived/` with a date suffix (`IMPROVEMENT_YYYY-MM-DD.md`) **only when the maintainer explicitly instructs it**. Never archived automatically when items are done.

New findings only enter this file while it is **not archived**. Once archived, a fresh `IMPROVEMENTS.md` is created for the next cycle.

## ID Scheme

Each item ID is `<LABEL_CODE>-<NNN>`, built from the **default GitHub labels** (no custom labels). The number counts up per label code, so each sequence is independent and never runs out.

| GitHub Label | Code |
|--------------|------|
| `bug` | BUG |
| `documentation` | DOC |
| `enhancement` | ENH |
| `duplicate` | DUP |
| `good first issue` | GFI |
| `help wanted` | HW |
| `invalid` | INV |
| `question` | QST |
| `wontfix` | WFX |

The label is encoded directly in the ID prefix. When a valid item becomes a GitHub Issue, the corresponding label is applied to it.

## Status Legend

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `recorded` | Logged, not yet deeply reviewed |
| `verified` | Deep review confirmed valid, Issue created |
| `rejected` | Deep review found it invalid — skipped |
| `implemented` | Linked Issue is closed |

## Field Guide

| Field | When filled | Content |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `Problem` | `recorded` | The finding described as application behavior when possible; for non-application items (CI, settings, tooling), describe the impact instead. |
| `Possible Fix` | `recorded` | The initial fix plan — written while still `recorded`, so it is not guaranteed to work. |
| `Actual Fix` | `verified` | The final fix plan confirmed during deep review. |
| `Actual Implemented` | `implemented` | What was actually changed during implementation. |
| `Changes` | `implemented` | The behavior changes that result after `implemented`. |
| `Issue` | `verified` | The GitHub Issue number (`#N`); recorded once the issue is opened. |
